  #   Use BetterHud to display your body health in game:
  #
  #      To make this wok, you need to install two plugins, if you don't have them already:
  #      PlaceholderAPI -> https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/
  #      ...and obviously BetterHud -> https://modrinth.com/plugin/betterhud2
  #
  #   When both plugins are installed, the following options activate:
  betterhud:
    # Automatically configure BetterHud to display body health
    inject-config: true
    # Show the body health hud to all players in survival mode as default
    as-default: true
    # Disable parts of BetterHuds default configuration that could get annoying
    disable:
      # Disable BetterHuds default hud (isn't beautiful, just annoying, trust me)
      default-hud: true
      # Disable BetterHuds default compass (compass HUD at the top of your screen)
      compass: true
    # Add stuff to BetterHud to make your life easier
    add:
      # Add a mcmeta file to BetterHuds output directory
      mcmeta: true
      # Add an icon to BetterHuds output directory
      icon: true
      # ^ If both of the above options are set to true, you can directly use the output directory as resource pack
