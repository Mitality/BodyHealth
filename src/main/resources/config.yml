  #   Use BetterHud to display your body health in game:
  #
  #      To make this wok, you need to install two plugins, if you don't have them already:        <--
  #      PlaceholderAPI -> https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/               <-- DON'T OVERLOOK THIS PART
  #      ...and obviously BetterHud -> https://modrinth.com/plugin/betterhud2                      <--
  #
  #   When both plugins are installed, the following options activate:
  betterhud:
    # Automatically configure BetterHud to display body health
    inject-config: true
    # Show the body health hud to all players **IN SURVIVAL MODE** as default
    as-default: true
    # Disable parts of BetterHuds default configuration that could get annoying
    disable:
      # Disable BetterHuds default hud (isn't beautiful, just annoying, trust me)
      default-hud: true
      # Disable BetterHuds default compass (compass HUD at the top of your screen)
      compass: true
    # Add stuff to BetterHud to make your life easier
    add:
      # Add a mcmeta file to BetterHuds output directory
      mcmeta: true
      # Add an icon to BetterHuds output directory
      icon: true
      # ^ If both of the above options are set to true, you can directly use the output directory as resource pack

    # Zip BetterHud assets to a usable resource pack located at BodyHealth/resource_pack.zip
    # (For inexperienced users: leave the above add-options set to true when using this!)
    zip: true

    # ^ IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO, LEAVE THE DISPLAY-SETTINGS UNTOUCHED AND USE THE RESOURCE PACK
    # LOCATED AT "plugins/BodyHealth/resource_pack.zip" TO VISUALIZE YOUR HEALTH PER BODY PART IN GAME
    # (YOU STILL NEED TO DOWNLOAD BOTH DEPENDENCIES FOR THIS TO WORK)


    # !!! ItemsAdder users read here !!!
    # ItemsAdder interferes with BetterHud on default settings. If you can't see the display
    # in game,  try adjusting the following settings as shown in your ItemsAdder config.yml:
    #
    #   effects:
    #      hide-scoreboard-numbers: false
    #      hide-scoreboard-numbers-old-clients: false
    #      text-effects:
    #         enabled: false
    #
    #   custom-font:
    #      enabled: false


  # Config complete and sanity still intact? Well done, you are awesome!
