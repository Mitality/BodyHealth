## List of ideas that will potentially be implemented in the future

- API for 3rd party plugins to hook into BodyHealth **✓**

- Addon System (for addons like thirst, stamina, and custom items) **✓**

- Internal display system without PAPI and BetterHud - currently not possible without making BodyHealth version-dependent, waiting for Game & API updates to make it possible
